Bullet Run (top-down wave-based shooting game)
Built on the Unity Game Engine, programmed in C#

------------------

Current state of the game (12/29/2022)
- I was given a 2-week window to build this project from scratch.
- In its current state, the game can easily be polished and expanded into something greater.
- The game is currently bare bones and the premise of the game is a simple objective:

- The game gets more difficult as more enemies are killed.
- At higher rounds, new enemies spawn, and then they will spawn at a higher rate.

- In this game, you only get one life; you get hit once, it is game over.
